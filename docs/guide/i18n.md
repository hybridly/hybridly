# Internationalization

## Overview

While Hybridly does not have much to do with internationalization, it provides an artisan command for converting Laravel lang files to JSON files that can be consumed by [`vue-18n`](https://vue-i18n.intlify.dev/).

Note that this feature will move to a separated package at some point.

## Command usage

Running `php artisan hybridly:i18n` will create a `resources/i18n/locales.json` file containing all locales. 

Optionally, it is possible to extract each locale in its own file by using the `--locales` option. When using that option, adding `--clean` will empty the locales directory before extraction.

:::tip Automatic re-generation
Note that, by default, translation files are automatically be re-generated when a change to a lang file is made. This is done by `vite-plugin-run`, which is [automatically incuded](../configuration/vite.md#run).

## Configuration

`config/hybridly.php` allows for a few configuration options.

```php
return [
  // ...
  'i18n' => [
    'lang_path' => base_path('lang'), // [!code focus:4]
    'locales_path' => resource_path('i18n/locales'),
    'file_name_template' => '{locale}.json',
    'file_name' => 'locales.json',
  ]
];
```

- **lang_path**: directory in which the lang files that need to be converted are defined.
- **locales_path**: directory in which translation files will be written.
- **file_name_template**: name template for the the individual locale files.
- **file_name**: name of the file that contain all translations.

## Usage with `vue-i18n`

The translation files generated by Hybridly are compatible with [`vue-i18n`](https://vue-i18n.intlify.dev/), which is the de-facto solution for translating Vue applications.

Its setup is rather trivial, but to globally benefit from TypeScript support, it needs to be configured by extending the [`DefineLocaleMessage`](https://vue-i18n.intlify.dev/guide/advanced/typescript.html#global-resource-schema-type-definition) interface. 

The following file demonstrates how to do this:

:::code-group
```ts [resources/application/i18n.ts]
import { createI18n } from 'vue-i18n'
import messages from '#/locales.json'

export type MessageSchema = typeof messages['en']

declare module 'vue-i18n' {
	export interface DefineLocaleMessage extends MessageSchema {}
}

const i18n = createI18n<[MessageSchema], 'en' | 'fr'>({
	locale: 'en',
	messages,
})

export default i18n
```
:::

This file can then be imported and registered as a Vue plugin:

```ts
import { initializeHybridly } from 'virtual:hybridly/config'
import i18n from './i18n' // [!code focus]

initializeHybridly({
	enhanceVue: (vue) => vue // [!code focus:2]
		.use(i18n)
})
```
