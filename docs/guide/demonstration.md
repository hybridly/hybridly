# Demonstration

## Overview

Blue Bird is an example application that showcases how to use Hybridly.

It's a Twitter mini-clone built in a way that should be familiar with Laravel developers. [`laravel-data`](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-data) and [TypeScript Transformer](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-typescript-transformer) are used to provide TypeScript definitions.

You can find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/hybridly/demo).

:::tip Hosted demonstration
A real-world application is being worked on and will replace Blue Bird. It will be a hosted, open-source web application built with best practices in mind.
