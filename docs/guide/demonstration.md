# Demonstration

## Overview

Blue Bird, a real-world application, showcases how to use Hybridly. 

It's a Twitter-like social network built with best practices in mind. [`laravel-data`](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-data) and [TypeScript Transformer](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-typescript-transformer) are used to provide TypeScript definitions.

You can find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/hybridly/demo).
