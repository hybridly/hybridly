# Upgrade guide

This guide describes how to upgrade from `v0.4.x` to `v0.5.x`.

## Updating the `views` directory

- **Likelihood of impact**: <span class="text-red-700 dark:text-red-300">high</span>

Previously, the views were stored in `resources/pages` by default. This has been changed back to `resources/views`:

```
resources/
├── application/
│   ├── main.ts
│   └── root.blade.php
├── layouts/
│   └── default.vue
├── pages/ // [!code --]
├── views/ // [!code ++]
│   ├── index.vue
│   └── security/
│       ├── register.vue
│       └── login.vue
├── utils/
└── composables/
```

Additionally, calls to [`loadModuleFrom`](../../api/laravel/hybridly.md#loadmodulefrom) and [`loadModulesFrom`](../../api/laravel/hybridly.md#loadmodulesfrom) expected view directories to be named `pages`. This has also been changed to `views`.

## Updating filters

- **Likelihood of impact**: <span class="text-orange-700 dark:text-orange-300">medium</span>
  
The refining system has been improved, and as such, some filters have changed. Specifically, the `ExactFilter`, `SimilarityFilter` and `EnumFilter` have been removed in favor of a simpler `Filter` class.

- `ExactFilter` is now `Filter`
- `SimilarityFilter` modes are available as methods in the `Filter` class
- `EnumFilter` is now the same as calling the `enum` method on `Filter`
- `FieldSort` is now `Sort`

More information in the [refining documentation](../refining.md#filter).

Additionally, some parameter names have changed, so you may have to adjust your code if you were using named parameters.
