# Upgrade guide

This guide describes how to upgrade from `v0.3.x` to `v0.4.x`.

## Updating the configuration

- **Likelihood of impact**: <span class="text-red-700 dark:text-red-300">high</span>

Previously, `hybridly.config.ts` was used to share settings between Hybridly and its Code extension. In 0.4.x, the architecture has changed and Hybridly now uses PHP to share its configuration.

You may delete `hybridly.config.ts` and configure the equivalent options in `config/hybridly.php`:

- `eager` -> `architecture.eager_load_views`
- `domains` -> `architecture.type` (accepts `default`, `domains` or `custom`)
- `root` -> `architecture.root`

```php
'architecture' => [
    'root' => 'resources',
    'eager_load_views' => true,
    'type' => 'domains',
],
```

Additionally, the `pages` and `layouts` options have been removed.

## Updating calls to views

- **Likelihood of impact**: <span class="text-red-700 dark:text-red-300">high</span>

Previously, when using the domain-based architecture, a page or layout could be specified using the `domain:name` syntax, where `domain` was the name of the `domain` and `name` the dot-notated path to the view relative to the domain.

This syntax has slightly changed to be more aligned with Laravel's base syntax, and is now using a double colon instead of a single colon:

:::code-group
```php [Views]
return view('security:login'); // [!code --]
return view('security::login'); // [!code ++]
```

```vue [Layouts]
<template layout="security:profile"> // [!code --]
<template layout="security::profile"> // [!code ++]
```
