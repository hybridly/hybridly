# Upgrade guide

This guide describes how to upgrade from `v0.3.x` to `v0.4.x`.

## Updating the configuration

- **Likelihood of impact**: <span class="text-red-700 dark:text-red-300">high</span>

Previously, `hybridly.config.ts` was used to share settings between Hybridly and its Code extension. In 0.4.x, the architecture has changed and Hybridly now uses PHP to share its configuration.

You may delete `hybridly.config.ts` and configure the equivalent options in `config/hybridly.php`:

- `eager` -> `architecture.eager_load_views`
- `domains` -> `architecture.preset` (accepts `default`, `modules` or `custom`)
- `root` -> `architecture.root`

```php
'architecture' => [
    'preset' => 'modules',
    'eager_load_views' => true,
    'root' => 'resources',
],
```

Additionally, the `pages` and `layouts` options have been removed.

## Updating calls to views

- **Likelihood of impact**: <span class="text-red-700 dark:text-red-300">high</span>

Previously, when using the domain-based architecture, a page or layout could be specified using the `domain:name` syntax, where `domain` was the name of the `domain` and `name` the dot-notated path to the view relative to the domain.

This syntax has slightly changed to be more aligned with Laravel's base syntax, and is now using a double colon instead of a single colon:

:::code-group
```php [Views]
return view('security:login'); // [!code --]
return view('security::login'); // [!code ++]
```

```vue [Layouts]
<template layout="security:profile"> // [!code --]
<template layout="security::profile"> // [!code ++]
```
:::

Additionally you also need to update all page component identifiers to lowercase:

:::code-group
```php [Views]
return view('Dashboard'); // [!code --]
return view('dashboard'); // [!code ++]
```
:::

## Updating `config/hybridly.php`

- **Likelihood of impact**: <span class="text-green-700 dark:text-green-300">low</span>

With the architectural changes, all options from the `testing` section of the configuration except `ensure_page_exist` are no longer needed and can be removed. 

Thanks to its improved reliability, it is recommend to set `ensure_page_exist` to `true`.

Additionally, you may want to add [the new `architecture` options](https://github.com/hybridly/hybridly/blob/0.x/packages/laravel/config/hybridly.php#L38-L42) to your existing file.

## Updating `main.ts`

- **Likelihood of impact**: <span class="text-green-700 dark:text-green-300">low</span>

If you were still importing `virtual:hybridly/router` manually, you will get an error when starting the development server. You may now remove this import.
